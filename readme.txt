welcome to CMSC11-Student Registration System

This is one one of our final project in CMSC11 with features that anyone can access if they are interested in. This is supposed to be like an enrollment system for students to different subjects, sections, grades, and etc. using only #include <stdio.h>, defined functions, and structs.

Here are the following functions that are in the code:

1.) Create Student
      > This part basically prompts the user to create a student record(s---)
      > This function also is divided into two, wherein the user may prompt to enroll a 
        student [manually] or through a [.csv] or [.txt] 
  
2.) Update Student Record
      > This lets the user update / edit any existing student record
      > 3.) Dropping Subjects
            > In any case the user wants a student to drop from a subject he/she is 
              enrolled
              
4.) Display Student Records
    > This allows the user to display all existing student records
    > 5.) Search Student Record
          > The user is also able to search for a specific student student record
          
6.) Delete Student Record
    > This allows the user to delete a specific student record while
    > 7.) The user is also able to delete ALL existing student record

8.) Statistics
    > From the inputted data (scores) of students, statistics are displayed accordingly
      with [min], [max], [average] values from all data records.
      
9.) Export Student Record
    > The user is also able to export all existing student record to a [.csv] file
    
10++) Subject Functions
    > Create Subject - The user is able to create certain subject records wherein
      a student may be able to enroll to.
      > The user may do this [manual] and or through a [file]
      
    > Edit Subject - The user may edit certain information of subject with this that
      will automatically be seen when using the display function
      
    > Search Subject - The user is able to search for a specific subject and be prompted
      to certain functions they wish to do
      
    > Delete Subject - The user is able to delete a subject
